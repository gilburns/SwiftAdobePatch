# SwiftAdobePatch
GUI for Adobe RemoteUpdateManager command line tool.

SwiftAdobePatch is an [open source](https://github.com/gilburns/SwiftAdobePatch/blob/main/LICENSE) utility for macOS 11+ that creates a graphical interface for Adobe RemoteUpdateManager command line tool. It will popup a dialog notifying users that there are available Adobe updates, allowing users to defer patches for a specific number of days. Once time has passed, the updates become mandatory and then users are prompted to close Adobe apps for patching.
